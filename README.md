## Analysis:

### Customer History:
All stores has 13,045 customers in total of which 49% are normal customers and 51% members.

### Product Catalog:
There are 8 product lines in the stores but the highest sold 6 are represented on the dashboard.
Also to note that Food and beverages have the highest sales.

### Transaction History:
There were 1.9M orders in total over the first quarter of the year.

### Store: 
There are 3 stores/branches currently running and Store A has the highest sales. 

## Conclusion and Recommendations:
The first 5 product line to finish are the ones with the highest sales
The city with the highest sales is Yangon.
Branch A is more on sales than other stores.

#Recommendation: 
The first 5 products should be restock as soon as possible based on weekly sales so the store won't run out of the products,
Both Yangon City and Branch (A) should be paid more attention to for redistribution
Other stores/branches should focus more on marketing and customer acquisition.
